## Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to **predict loan default risk** using historical customer data. It is designed with business impact in mind and is targeted at financial institutions seeking data-driven solutions to minimize Non-Performing Loans (NPLs).


## Business and Data Understanding

### Stakeholder Audience
The primary audience for this project includes:
- Credit Risk Managers
- Lending Officers
- Banking Executives
- Data Strategy Teams in Financial Institutions

These stakeholders aim to enhance their credit assessment process and reduce losses arising from loan defaults.


### Dataset Choice
The dataset used includes **10,000 customer records** from  **KAGGLE DATASET** with financial and demographic variables relevant to credit risk evaluation. Key variables include:

- `Employed`: Employment status (binary)
- `Bank Balance`, `Loan Amount`, `Annual Salary`, `Savings Rate`
- `Defaulted?`: Target variable indicating if a customer defaulted


## Problem Statements

1. Can we predict whether a customer will default on a loan using historical financial and demographic data?
2. What features most influence the likelihood of loan default?
3. Which model performs better between **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree**?


## Modeling

The following steps were used to develop and train the models:

- Data cleaning and handling of missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering (e.g., encoding employment, creating savings rate)
- Train-test split using stratification
- Model training with:
  - Logistic Regression (baseline)
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Hyperparameter tuning for Decision Tree

---

## Evaluation

Model performance was evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC

**Key results:**
- Logistic Regression showed high accuracy but failed to detect defaulters (low recall).
- Decision Tree, after applying SMOTE, achieved significantly better recall and F1-score.

---

## Conclusion

The Decision Tree model provided the best balance of performance and interpretability, especially after handling class imbalance with SMOTE. This model is well-suited for deployment in credit risk workflows to:
- Flag high-risk borrowers early
- Support risk-based pricing
- Reduce non-performing loans

This project demonstrates how machine learning can enhance lending strategies through data-driven insights.
