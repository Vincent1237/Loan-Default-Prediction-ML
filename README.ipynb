    "# Loan Default Prediction Project\n",

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to **predict loan default risk** using historical customer data. It is designed with business impact in mind and is targeted at financial institutions seeking data-driven solutions to minimize Non-Performing Loans (NPLs).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Business Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a predictive model that helps banks:\n",
    "- Identify likely loan defaulters before disbursement.\n",
    "- Improve risk-based pricing models.\n",
    "- Support proactive recovery and early intervention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can we predict whether a customer will default on a loan using historical financial and demographic data?\n",
    "2. What features most influence the likelihood of loan default?\n",
    "3. Which model performs better between **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree**?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains **10,000 records** with customer financial indicators.  \n",
    "Key features include:\n",
    "- `Employed`: Employment status (binary)\n",
    "- `Bank Balance`, `Loan Amount`, `Income`, `Savings Rate`\n",
    "- `Defaulted?`: Target variable (1 = Defaulted, 0 = Not Defaulted)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "3. **Train-Test Split**\n",
    "4. **Modeling** (Logistic Regression & Decision Tree)\n",
    "5. **Handling Class Imbalance using SMOTE**\n",
    "6. **Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC**\n",
    "7. **Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Results Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression had high accuracy but very low recall.\n",
    "- After applying **SMOTE**, recall improved significantly for Decision Trees.\n",
    "- Decision Tree outperformed in identifying actual defaulters (higher recall and F1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- SMOTE effectively addressed class imbalance.\n",
    "- Decision Tree provided better interpretability and actionable insights.\n",
    "- The model supports proactive decision-making for credit risk teams.\n",
